# Temperature Conversion Program

This program will prompt the user for a temperature in Celsius. The temperature in celsius is then converted into fharenheit and kelvin. The temperature displays all instances of the input celsius subtracted by 5 until it is no longer greater than -40. The output is neatly formatted using iomanip.

This program demonstrates the ability to perform mathematical algorithms and display the results in a neatly organized output. This program displays skill in fundamental mathematical algorithms in C++.
